# 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction

## 🔍 Overview
- **Goal:** Predict wine quality based on physicochemical properties.  
- **Why it matters:** Quality assessment helps producers and consumers; regression/classification models provide practical ML experience.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle – Wine Quality Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009)  
- **Size & Features:** 1,599 red wine samples, 12 features (fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol, quality)  
- **Preprocessing:** Checked for missing values, normalized continuous variables, and handled skewed distributions.

## ⚙️ Methods & Tools
- **Languages/Libraries:** Python, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, tensorflow
- **Models / Techniques:** Tensorflow Model
- **Evaluation:** MAE, R²  

## 📈 Results
- **Key Insights:** volatile acidity had the largest influence on wine quality.  

## 💡 Learning Outcomes
- Learned tensorflow modelling and evaluation metrics.  
- Practiced feature importance interpretation.  
- Developed skills in handling and preprocessing numeric datasets.

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Convert problem into classification (good vs bad wine).  
- Explore ensemble methods for improved predictive performance.  
- Add more models, such as regression models.

## 📍 How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
Open and run notebooks/wine_quality.ipynb.
