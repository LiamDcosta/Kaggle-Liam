Predicting Wine Quality from range of chemical properties.
This Project Explores the Wine quality of various red wines, looking at the properties, such as pH, citric acid levels and nitric acid levels.
As someone interested in the Chemical Properties., I was interested in using data science to see how they impact the suggested wine quality.
I used Python.Numpy,pandas,matplotlib and seaborn to analyse the dataset and Scikit-learn, and tensor flow to create the machine learning model. I got the dataset from kaggle.
the dataset is from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009
i Collected the data from kaggle. I analysed the data, then created a machine learning model. I made charts for my analysis,and made a graph to look at the accuracy of my model
My model was pretty accurate. Quality had some negative correlation to volatile acidity, but not much other correlation.
