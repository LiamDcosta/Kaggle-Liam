# 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction

## 📌 Overview
This project predicts wine quality based on physicochemical properties using regression and classification models.

## 💡 Motivation
Wine quality prediction is a classic machine learning dataset, useful for learning regression techniques and interpreting feature importance in real-world data.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib,tensorflow)
- Models: Tensor Flow
- Metrics: MAE, R² (for regression)

## 📁 Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle – Wine Quality Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009)

## 🔎 Methodology
1. Load and explore dataset  
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
3. EDA: histograms, correlations, heatmap  
4. Split into train/test sets  
5. Train models
6. Evaluate using MAE, R²  
7. Analyse feature importance  

## 📊 Results
- MAE: 0.04
- R² Score: 74.8%  
- Key features affecting wine quality: Volatile acidity had most correlation, but even then only moderate correleation.

## 🧠 Reflections
- Next step: treat wine quality as a classification problem (good vs bad) for easier interpretability. Use more models, such as Random Forest of Logistic Regression.

## 📍 How to Run
1. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
Run the notebook wine_quality.ipynb.
