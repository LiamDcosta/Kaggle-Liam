1️⃣ Breast Cancer Classification

# 🔬 Breast Cancer Classification

## 🔍 Overview
- **Goal:** Classify tumors as malignant or benign using supervised learning models.  
- **Why it matters:** Early and accurate detection can save lives. This project helps practice classification, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle – Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data)  
- **Size & Features:** ~569 rows, 32 features including radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, etc.  
- **Preprocessing:** Removed ID column, handled missing values, scaled features where needed.

## ⚙️ Methods & Tools
- **Languages/Libraries:** Python, pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn  
- **Models / Techniques:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest 
- **Evaluation:** : boxplot

## 📈 Results
- **Best Model:** both models have same accuracy  
- **Accuracy:** 98% 

## 💡 Learning Outcomes
- Practiced classification algorithms and feature selection.  
- Learned to evaluate models.  

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation.  
- Compare additional tree-based models like XGBoost or Gradient Boosting.  

## 📍 How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
Open and run notebooks/breast_cancer.ipynb.
