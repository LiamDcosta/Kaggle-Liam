# 🔬 Breast Cancer Classification

## 📌 Overview
This project uses the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset to classify tumours as malignant or benign using supervised learning models.

## 💡 Motivation
Medical datasets provide a meaningful challenge for practising classification techniques. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial in healthcare, so this project shows how machine learning can support decision-making.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn,matplotlib,seaborn)
- Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest
- Visualisation: matplotlib, seaborn

## 📁 Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle – Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data)

## 🔎 Methodology
1. Load and inspect dataset  
2. Preprocess data (remove ID column, scale features if necessary)  
3. Split into train/test sets  
4. Train models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)  
5. Evaluate models
6. Compare performance and visualise results  

## 📊 Results
- Both Models were very accurate, both had over 97% of tumors identified correctly.

## 🧠 Reflections
- Future work: try cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and gradient boosting models.

## 📍 How to Run
1. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
Run the notebook breast_cancer.ipynb in Jupyter or Google Colab.
