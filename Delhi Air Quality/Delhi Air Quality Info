# 🌫 Delhi Air Quality Analysis

## 🔍 Overview
- **Goal:** Analyze air pollution trends and seasonal patterns in Delhi.  
- **Why it matters:** Air quality impacts health and quality of life. Time series analysis helps understand patterns and identify periods of high pollution.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle – Delhi Air Quality Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/air-quality-data-in-india)  
- **Size & Features:** Hourly pollutant readings (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO, etc.) over multiple years.  
- **Preprocessing:** checked missing values, handled outliers.

## ⚙️ Methods & Tools
- **Languages/Libraries:** Python, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sci-kit learn, tensorflow.
- **Techniques:** Time series analysis, rolling averages, seasonal decomposition  
- **Evaluation:** Visual inspection and trend analysis  

## 📈 Results
- PM2.5 levels peaked during winter months.  
- Strong correlation observed between PM2.5 and PM10 levels.  
- Patterns highlighted pollution spikes during festival seasons.  
- strong correlation between AQI, and PM2.5,PM10 and CO levels.

## 💡 Learning Outcomes
- Improved skills in time series data handling.  
- Learned to visualize and interpret seasonal trends and correlations.  
- Developed ability to clean and process environmental datasets.

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Forecast future pollutant levels using ARIMA or Prophet.  
- Compare Delhi’s air quality trends with other major cities.  

## 📍 How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
