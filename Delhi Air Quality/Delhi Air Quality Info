Predicting Air Quality Index in Delhi based on various pollutant levels.
This Project Explores the Air quality in Delhi, looking at the pollutant levels over the year, their relation to each other, and making a model to predict the Air Quality Index value.
As someone interested in the Environment, I am interested in using data science to decrease the amount of air pollution, which causes Asthma and other harmful side effects.
I used Python.Numpy,pandas,matplotlib and seaborn to analyse the dataset and Scikit-learn to create the machine learning model. I got the dataset from kaggle.
