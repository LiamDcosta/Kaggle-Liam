# 🌫 Delhi Air Quality Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project analyses air pollution levels in Delhi using time series data, exploring seasonal patterns, pollutant correlations, and potential forecasting.

## 💡 Motivation
Air quality is a pressing issue in India and globally. This project helped me apply time series techniques and data visualisation to environmental data, linking personal interest in current affairs with practical analysis.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy,ski-kit learn, tensorflow)
- graphs, histogram, boxplots
- model: tensorflow

## 📁 Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle – Delhi Air Quality Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/air-quality-data-in-india)

## 🔎 Methodology
1. Load and clean the dataset (handle missing timestamps, outliers)  
2. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): pollutant trends, correlations  
3. Plot seasonal variation (hourly, daily, monthly patterns)  
4. Create and Evalutate model

## 📊 Results
- Key pollutants: PM2.5, PM10, CO
- Seasonal pattern: highest AQI in Winter, Lowest in Summer.
- Correlation found between [pollutant1] and [pollutant2]  
- Forecast model achieved RMSE = 0.092 (if attempted)  

## 🧠 Reflections  
- Clear seasonal spikes were visible.  
- Next step: compare Delhi with other Indian cities or global cities.  

## 📍 How to Run
1. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
Open and run the notebook delhi_air_quality.ipynb.
